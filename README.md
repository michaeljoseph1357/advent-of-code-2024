## Daily Challenges

### Day 1: Historian Hysteria
#### Part 1
The Chief Historian is missing, and you need to reconcile two lists of location IDs to find out where to search. Calculate the total distance between two lists by pairing the smallest numbers and summing the absolute differences.

#### Part 2
Using the same lists, determine a similarity score by counting occurrences of each number from the left list in the right list and calculating the weighted sum.

### Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports
#### Part 1
Analyze reports from the Red-Nosed reactor to determine which are safe. A report is safe if the levels are strictly increasing or decreasing and all differences between adjacent levels are within a valid range.

#### Part 2
Update the analysis with the Problem Dampener, allowing the safety system to tolerate a single bad level. Reclassify unsafe reports as safe if removing one level makes the report valid.
